              Ravi Sir's Classes is the ideal learning ground for all competitive exams. The structured programme, long one
              to one sessions, comprehensive and updated question banks, flexibility with timings help a lot to handle the
              stressful preparations. However, it’s his individual attention and support that distinguishes him from all
              the other "coaching centres. It enables you to spend time on concepts which appears tough to you whereas
              save time on those where you have a good grasp. I still remember getting a 5 marker quants question straight
              from his concept classes in my XAT paper. May be it made all the difference.
              Sir, you are a lot better then what I have expressed here. I am limited by my vocabulary to thank you
              enough.

            Ravi Raja Sir adds a personalized touch to the coaching. I wrote CAT thrice – the first two years I
            registered with two different brand names. However, the third time when I actually made it through with a
            percentile of 99.90, Ravi Raja Sir was my coach. His exhaustive list of Quant problems gave me the
            confidence required to ensure a 100 percentile in this section. Basically he taught me approaches to all the
            different kinds of problems that I could be tested in each topic. The verbal training was also good. In my
            opinion, one has to be one’s own master when honing the verbal aptitude. No amount of coaching can help you
            if you do not spend enough time reading – books, magazines, news articles and NOT facebook / whatsapp etc.
            Ravi Sir’s tips on what to read and a general discussion on trending topics did help me a lot.
            Overall I would highly recommend Ravi Sir’s Classes to anyone aspiring to be a B-School entrant – especially
            over coaching institutes.

            I joined Ravi Raja's Classes for GMAT coaching and was very happy with the classes. Ravi Sir's classes
            provides a lot of study material designed to prepare a student thoroughly for the test. Along with this
            material, online mock tests are also provided. The class is taught in the same was as any other class, that
            is, first a topic is taught in class and all concepts are explained and then students are expected to
            practice for the study material given. But, the class comprises of a relatively small number of students
            allowing Ravi Sir to give each and every student enough personal attention and clear each and every doubt.
            The class timings are also flexible and this allows the students to come and practice according to the
            student's convenience (except for the class in which a new topic is taught).
            All said, I personally had a good experience and the classes helped me score a 690 on my GMAT in a short
            span of time.

            My introduction to Ravi Sir happened last year through a brother of mine and his fellow colleague at one of
            the most renowned CAT coaching centres in Kolkata. As a young Comp Science student in St. Xavier's, I too
            had dreams to bell the CAT, and my brother suggested that Ravi Sir was the best bet to do that. Years later,
            I had found that I had not only met a brilliant teacher but a mentor in him as well. Ravi Sir's teaching
            methods are novel and his approach to problem solving are amazing. The materials that are provided by him,
            are but problems that his years of experience have identified to clarify the concepts of understanding a
            particular topic. Above all, as a teacher he is exemplary in his patience to explain a concept to a curious
            student. I can vouchsafe about the fact, that over the years as several batches of students who have been
            tutored by him have made it to the hallowed portals of the IIM's and MDI's, each and everyone of them would
            recall Ravi Sir with reverence because he is not just a mere professional, but a person for whom teaching is
            his vocation as well his avocation, who revels in the success of his students through sheer hard work and
            dedication that he gives for them. Therefore, I can assure you that Ravi Sir is a teacher par excellence and
            a guide who can fulfill your dreams of clearing as difficult an exam like CAT.

            Sir it was great being your student, the classes especially the Maths really helped me improve my speed.
            That booklet had hundreds of questions of all the chapters solving them helped clearing the concepts and the
            techniques helped too. I remember sitting in your classes for hours and solving them and you attending to all
            my doubts and giving me tricks to shorten the same.
            About the portal, the question set were really robust, covered all sorts of questions of various difficulties.
            It’s because of that I could crack CAT I believe. Also sir, you attended to all my doubts even on WhatsApp.
            I will be really grateful for all your help and guidance.

            Studying at Ravi Raja’s Classes has been an absolute enriching experience for me. I joined the institute
            as someone who was terrified of Mathematics, but within a couple of months, the subject became my strength.
            Be it in terms of Ravi Sir's excellent lectures or the flexible class timings, be it the all – embracing
            study material or the comprehensive test series, every detail to make us CAT – ready was well taken care of
            by at Ravi Raja’s Classes. From the exam tips to the shortcuts to save time to the words of encouragement,
            Ravi Sir's constant guidance is what has helped me get calls from good B – Schools. Sir certainly made QA
            and LRDI simpler. He had been very patient and was literally available 24 x 7. The GDPI faculties have also
            been remarkable.
            Without a doubt, I'm glad I joined Ravi Raja’s Classes for MBA Entrance Preparations.

            Joining Ravi Raja's Classes, was one of the best decisions I made in my journey of preparing for MBA
            entrance examinations. We were motivated to give our best, from the very beginning till the time, we entered
            the premises of our dream business schools. A student has the flexibility to attend the classes as per his
            schedule which does not prohibit him from pursuing an internship / job and attending his classes. The key to
            ace these exams is to prepare regularly and Ravi Sir helped us in doing just that by providing us with a
            time table for daily tasks and monthly targets that kept on upgrading as the exams drew closer. This helped
            us in preparing for our exams in a structured manner and we could keep track of our performances. Concepts
            are taught in a lucid manner and doubts are solved on the spot, which helps you in completing your syllabus
            on time, thereby providing with you ample time to practice mock tests. The standard of the mock test papers
            were up to the mark and quite similar to the actual test papers. The GD/PI preparations start a month in
            advance from the date of your actual college interview, which gives you enough time to prepare for the next
            step. We had guest lecturers, who are an alumni of esteemed institutes like IIM Ahmedabad and are panelists
            themselves for leading business schools of India. They have immense knowledge and experience and their views
            on various subjects and the current affairs of the world, helped me profoundly in my actual GD/PI. Over this
            one month of GD/PI classes, the classes are held almost everyday, so you do not miss out on a day's
            preparation and by the time you appear for the interview, it just seems like another mock session.
            Ravi Sir’s coaching doesn't end here, He is there with you until you make it to the b – school of your
            choice. Your teachings and the memories will stay with me for life Sir and I am blessed to be your student.

            My experience at Ravi raja classes has been amazing. Two things that separate it from other coaching
            institutes are the personal attention and the easy approach to problems.
            The way you planned discussion classes for every assignment gave me enough ye to understand the topics and
            even if I was unable to complete those, listening to the doubts of others added a lot of value.
            Constant feedbacks and motivation from your side, added to whatever little motivation I had. I really
            learned a lot from you, and I'm glad I chose to take classes here.
            I was able to get through a college this year, then it was all because of your help.
            Thank you, sir!

            It was an amazing experience at Ravi Raja's classes since the beginning.
            Ravi sir's strongest characteristic is that he is an extremely dedicated and responsible teacher. By far,
            through school and college, we all have come across a number of teachers who have made us what we are today.
            Not denying their contributions, Ravi Sir's contribution and commitment towards his students is unparalleled.
            Ravi sir's mode of teaching is unique from the other coaching centres of the same field. When I enrolled my
            name here, my friends joined other coaching centres. As the months passed, they started talking about how
            huge their strength of each class used to be, and how individual attention was overlooked in all of those
            coaching centres. Here, I was proud to tell them that in Ravi Sir's classes, though batch classes were held,
            but if any particular student was unable to follow his lesson or felt uncomfortable in batch classes,
            he/she/they could easily go up to Sir and ask him to teach them the whole lesson once again personally at
            his coaching centre. Ravi Sir never hesitated to agree to the same and instantly asked him/her/them when
            they could come individually and take the lesson from him. He is there in the coaching centre everyday from
            9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and anyone can visit his coaching centre and can take personal lessons from him or
            simply sit and practice numericals on the already completed chapters. His flexibility with his students is
            remarkable.
            Ravi sir's expertise in the subjects of Data Interpretation, Data Sufficiency, Quantitative Aptitude and
            Logical Reasoning is incomparable. For the English section too, the faculty here is just as efficient.
            Verbal Faculty is truly a great English teacher and is also adept in the language herself.
            The best part of the total experience here at Ravi Raja's Classes was the Group Discussion and Personal
            Interview (GDPI) sessions held towards the end part, once the students have finished appearing for the
            competitive exams (CAT, XAT, SNAP, NMAT etc.) and start to receive interview calls from the B – schools.
            Most of us have not faced the interview panel up till graduation, so it is only obvious to feel nervous and
            shaky whenever the thought of facing the board of interviewers comes to our mind. I can share my own
            experience here – I was the most shy, introvert and nervous prospective interviewee one can imagine.
            Soft spoken as I was since childhood, I was definitely not one of those outspoken or extrovert children.
            I knew absolutely nothing about facing an interview. With scanty General Knowledge (which is one of the key
            requirements in this process) and weak aptitude in answering known questions when asked, I shivered at the
            thought of public speaking (extempore), participating in group discussions or going through a personal
            interview. I give tremendous credit to the GDPI classes held at Ravi Raja's Classes coaching centre for
            helping me overcome all my weaknesses in this field. All faculty members for GDPI classes, for conducting
            mock interviews, mock group discussions and mock extempores to prepare us, were brilliant – put shortly.
            Each of them are either IIM – A, IIM – C alumni or public speakers by profession. These classes are a must –
            attend here, at Ravi sir's coaching. Genuinely, they are too helpful for students like me to miss. It is
            definitely a cherry on the cake, following his flawless training for appearing for the written exams
            (CAT, XAT, SNAP, NMAT etc).
            That's all that I felt across these two years since I enrolled my name in Ravi Raja's Classes for taking the
            management entrance examinations. A heartfelt gratitude towards Ravi Sir and everyone else here at the
            coaching centre for their invaluable help and contribution towards our lives. Thank you for everything.
